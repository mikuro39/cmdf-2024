## Inspiration
Our project was inspired by our personal stories as women in STEM. Being in classrooms and workspaces where women are underrepresented, it can be challenging to find your footing in the tech world.

## What it does
Drawing inspiration from the engaging mechanics of modern dating apps, STEMPower-Her incorporates a unique swiping feature tailored to programming languages. This innovative approach enables us to craft personalized learning guide options for various tech career paths, specifically designed for women. As users advance in their learning journey, the platform adeptly connects them with like-minded women in STEM who share similar paths, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. Through gamification, customization, and a growing network, STEMPower-Her not only empowers women in tech but also makes the learning experience enjoyable, reducing feelings of isolation and underrepresentation in the STEM fields.

## How we built it
We used Javascript/HTML/CSS for frontend, Spline for 3D design and Node.js and Mongo.DB for backend.

## Challenges we ran into
Our main challenge was integrating the frontend with the backend. We also ran into some fun merge conflicts we had to handle at the end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the basic general prototype we were able to build within 24 hours with a creative integration of 3D web design and animations.

## What we learned
We learned how to work with MongoDB and new design tools such as Spline and Figma.

## What's next for STEMPOWER-HER
With more time, we would have added multiple tracks within the tech field, as well as increasing the accessibility by building more shortcuts to provide users with interactive experience. In the future, we'd love to use React to its full potential by implementing the swiping feature.
